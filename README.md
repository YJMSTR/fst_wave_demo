# FST Wave Demo

A demonstration project for working with FST (Fast Signal Trace) waveform files using the libfst library from GTKWave.

## Overview

This project provides a simple example of how to use the libfst library to write FST waveform files. The FST format is a compact and efficient format for storing digital waveform data, commonly used in digital design and verification.

## Prerequisites

- C compiler (gcc)
- Make

## Building

To build the project:

```bash
make
```

This will compile the source files and create the executable.

After building, you can run the demo:

```bash
./build/fstdemo
```

or you can build and run the project directly:

```bash
make run
```
